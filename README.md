**House Price Prediction Project**
__Overview__
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, square footage, number of rooms, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, we built a model that can estimate the price of a house given certain input features. The project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression models to solve a real-world problem.

**Key Technologies**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning (for regression models, feature selection, and model evaluation)
**Objective**
The primary goal of this project was to develop a model that can predict house prices accurately based on the dataset features. By analyzing the dataset, cleaning the data, and using appropriate regression models, we aimed to predict the price with a reasonable level of accuracy.

Steps Involved
Data Collection:
The project uses a publicly available dataset that contains information about houses, such as size, location, number of rooms, etc.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and handled missing values.
Converted categorical data into numerical format using encoding techniques.
Normalized data where necessary to bring features to a comparable scale.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
Identified key patterns and correlations between various features like square footage and price.
Model Building:

Applied multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression).
Split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Tuned the model for improved accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

Used performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) to evaluate the model’s effectiveness.
Visualization:

Visualized model results using plots to help communicate the predictions and underlying patterns in the data.
Results
The final model is capable of predicting house prices based on input features, with a reasonable accuracy based on evaluation metrics like R².
Visualizations reveal important trends and insights that help inform pricing strategies in the real estate sector.
