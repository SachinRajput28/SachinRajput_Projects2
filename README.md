# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, square footage, and more. Using machine learning techniques, we build a regression model to predict the prices of houses. The project includes steps for **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **model training** using regression algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of relationships and patterns in the dataset.
- **Regression Modeling**: Building a machine learning model to predict house prices using regression techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **RÂ² Score**.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual insights to showcase the impact of various features on house prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas` (Data manipulation and cleaning)
  - `NumPy` (Mathematical operations)
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Data visualization)
  - `Scikit-learn` (Machine learning model building)
